			<h1>Sustainability and Leadership Reflection</h1>
			<p>Reflection on the experience of overseeing a small team at Perfect Engineering Pty Ltd</p>
		</header>

		<section class="reflection" id="recount">
			<h2>I) Recount</h2>
			<p>During my internship at Perfect Engineering Pty Ltd, I was entrusted with leading a small team tasked
				with
				developing plans for parking lots, roadworks, and retaining walls. Our primary focus was ensuring that
				our
				designs adhered to Australian Standards while integrating sustainable methods. I had to manage the
				team's
				workflow, coordinate discussions, and ensure that the project deadlines were met while maintaining a
				high
				standard of sustainability.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="reflection" id="feelings">
			<h2>II) Feelings</h2>
			<p>I felt a mixture of excitement and pressure. It was exhilarating to have the chance to apply
				sustainability
				concepts to real-world projects. However, I also felt the weight of responsibility as I balanced
				technical
				requirements with leadership duties. It was challenging to ensure that the designs were functional and
				sustainable at the same time. As the team collaborated and solved problems, my confidence grew, and I
				became
				more comfortable in my role.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="reflection" id="beliefs">
			<h2>III) Beliefs</h2>
			<p>This experience reinforced my belief that sustainability should be a core value that guides all
				engineering
				decisions. I realized that good leadership is about creating a vision that others can rally behind,
				whether it's
				about teamwork, innovation, or sustainability. Furthermore, I learned that effective leadership involves
				ensuring that everyone shares the same understanding of the project's goals and working towards a common
				purpose.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="reflection" id="recognising-difficulties">
			<h2>IV) Recognising Difficulties</h2>
			<p>One of the main difficulties we faced was balancing sustainability with cost-efficiency. Some of the
				sustainable design options seemed too expensive or impractical initially, which caused disagreements
				within the
				team. Ensuring that everyone understood the significance of sustainability and its integration into the
				design
				process required ongoing communication and encouragement. These challenges highlighted the importance of
				decisive leadership and the ability to mediate differing opinions.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="reflection" id="perspective">
			<h2>V) Perspective</h2>
			<p>Reflecting on the experience, I recalled the triple bottom line concept, which stresses the need to
				balance
				social, environmental, and financial goals. Sustainable engineering also emphasizes life cycle thinking,
				ensuring that products have minimal environmental impact over their entire lifespan. This reinforced my
				understanding that sustainability often requires long-term thinking and innovative problem-solving, even
				when
				faced with immediate challenges.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="reflection" id="lessons">
			<h2>VI) Lessons</h2>
			<p>This experience taught me that incorporating sustainability into engineering projects requires both
				technical
				expertise and strong leadership skills. Good communication and collaboration are essential for
				overcoming
				obstacles and achieving shared goals. In the future, I aim to expand my knowledge of sustainable
				engineering
				techniques and encourage teamwork in my projects. I aspire to be a leader who promotes sustainability
				and
				inspires others to find innovative and practical solutions that benefit both society and the
				environment.</p>
