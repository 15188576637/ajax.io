			<p>Reflection on the experience working with a diverse team at Perfect Engineering Pty Ltd</p>
		</header>

		<section class="reflection" id="recount">
			<h2>I) Recount</h2>
			<p>During my internship at Perfect Engineering Pty Ltd, I got the opportunity to work with engineers from a
				variety of cultural and professional backgrounds. One of our responsibilities was to assess structural
				designs
				to ensure conformity with Australian standards. Leading talks and distributing work in this team was
				both
				fascinating and demanding. Everyone brought a distinct perspective to the table, making the event
				extremely
				lively and fulfilling.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="reflection" id="feelings">
			<h2>II) Feelings</h2>
			<p>At first, I was unsure how to deal with the team's diverse communication and working styles. I wanted
				everyone
				to feel heard while yet staying on track. However, as the project continued, I grew to appreciate the
				varied
				perspectives my teammates provided. What began as a struggle evolved into an invaluable learning
				opportunity
				that taught me the value of adaptability and open-mindedness.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="reflection" id="beliefs">
			<h2>III) Beliefs</h2>
			<p>This encounter confirmed my opinion that variety is an asset. I've always felt that teamwork is based on
				mutual
				respect, but this project demonstrated how cultural awareness can strengthen collaboration. I also
				realised that
				being a professional today entails being globally aware and understanding how other perspectives may
				enrich the
				way we address challenges.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="reflection" id="recognising-difficulties">
			<h2>IV) Recognising Difficulties</h2>
			<p>One of the issues I had was dealing with communication style discrepancies. Some team members valued
				direct,
				honest feedback, while others were more guarded. Misunderstandings hampered our progress, and balancing
				these
				differences required work. I also realised that my leadership style needed to adapt to the individual
				and the
				scenario.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="reflection" id="perspective">
			<h2>V) Perspective</h2>
			<p>Reflecting on this, I considered cultural intelligence—the capacity to operate effectively in varied
				settings—and how important it is for modern engineers. I also drew on what I've learned about global
				leadership,
				particularly the value of empathy and adaptation. Recognising these notions helped me appreciate the
				importance
				of being adaptable and inclusive when leading different teams.</p>
		</section>

		<section class="reflection" id="learning">
			<h2>VI) Learning</h2>
			<p>This experience showed me that working in an intercultural situation entails more than just technical
				skills;
				it's about connecting with others, adapting, and learning from them. Moving forward, I hope to further
				improve
				my capacity to work in diverse teams by pursuing opportunities to engage with people from all
				backgrounds. My
				ambition is to become a leader who can inspire collaboration and innovation while also promoting
				diversity and
				respect in all projects.</p>
